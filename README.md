# Triadic-Theory
Triadic Theory proposes that local phenomena arise as propagation effects from three irreducible relational axes: Space (boundary/catalyst), Entropy (directional change), and Potentiality (pre-form openness). Consciousness is a localized propagation vector that collapses potential into persistent form
# Triadic Theory & ERVC — Public Repository

## Overview
Triadic Theory posits three irreducible axes — Space, Entropy, Potentiality — whose relational interplay yields propagation, awareness, and material effects. ERVC (Entangled Relational Vector Calculus) is the working formalism for encoding propagation signatures and testing predictions.

This repository contains:
- canonical abstract (canonical_abstract.md)
- experimental protocols (experiments/)
- reference drafts (docs/)
- code prototypes (code/)
- archival artifacts (hashes/)

## Goals
1. Preserve provenance and authorship publicly.
2. Provide replicable experiments and protocols.
3. Open invitation for collaboration under permissive license.

## Quick start
- Read `canonical_abstract.md`.
- See `experiments/text_alignment_protocol.md` for immediate, low-cost tests you can run locally.
- To contribute: make a pull request or open an issue.

## License & Governance
- Suggested license: **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)** for text; **MIT** or **Apache 2.0** for code.
- Governance: inclusive PR review, documented Code of Conduct (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`), and transparent changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`).

## Provenance & Timestamping
- Each commit must include a signed statement and content hash in `hashes/`. See `provenance/README.md` for the protocol.

## Contact & Collaboration
- Public contact: [email/contact method you choose]
- Optional: maintain a `WIKI.md` for living ideas and meeting notes.
